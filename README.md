# Movie Characters API

Movie Characters API was completed for the third Java assignment in the Noroff Accelerate backend program. 
The project was made by Mika Hoffren and Aino Yl√§-Outinen.

## How to run

After cloning the project there are multiple ways to get project running.

### With Docker

Use supplied `docker-compose.yaml` file. You will need `docker-compose` on your machine.

Execute following at the project root directory

- `docker-compose up`

Everything is executed within containers. You might want to run `docker-compose down` after you are done.

### With IDE / terminal

For these you will need to have Postgres instance running on your local machine e.g. database at `localhost:5432/movieDB` needs to exists. For example this can be done with PgAdmin tool.

- You can execute the project with most IDEs. Please note that the project utilizes maven.

Or if you prefer terminal

- `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
- `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.easpringapi.EaSpringApiApplication`

### API endpoints 

In all cases the project will launch to `localhost:8080`. You can check api endpoints at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
